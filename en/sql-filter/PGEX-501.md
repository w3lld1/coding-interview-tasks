Output the names of all members in one column `name`, formatted as `Surname, Firstname` (a comma and a space between the parts). Row order does not matter.

The tables and data are already in the starter code and are created afresh on every run (SQLite):

- `facilities(facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)` — club facilities; `membercost` and `guestcost` are the price of one slot for a member and for a guest.
- `members(memid, surname, firstname, address, zipcode, telephone, recommendedby, joindate)` — members; `recommendedby` is the `memid` of who invited them, or `NULL`; `memid = 0` is a guest.
- `bookings(bookid, facid, memid, starttime, slots)` — bookings; one slot is 30 minutes; `starttime` is text such as `2012-09-14 09:00:00`.
